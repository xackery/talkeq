### Service Descriptions

* Telnet - EQEMU uses this as a way to communicate with the server
* EQLog - Everquest's client generates a log when you type /log, and it logs data the client sees
* PEQEditorSQLLog - EQEMU's PEQ Editor is configured to log sql events, you can relay this info to discord
* Discord - Chat service that lets you relay information to it via bots

## Discord Setup

### Create a bot

* Go to https://discordapp.com/developers/ and sign in
* Click New Application the top right area
* Write anything you wish for the app name, click Create App
* Copy the CLIENT ID into your talkeq.conf's discord client_id section
* Select your server, and allow it.
* On the left pane, click Bot
* Press Add Bot, Yes, do it!
* Press the copy button in the Token section
* Uncheck the Public Bot option
* Replace on this link's {CLIENT_ID} field with the client ID you obtained earlier. https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?&client_id={CLIENT_ID}&scope=bot&permissions=268504064 
* Open the link and authorize your bot to access your server.
* Ensure the bot now appears offline on your server's general channel


### Configure discord users to talk from Discord to EQ

#### Using Discord Roles

* (Admin-level accounts on Discord can only do the following steps.)
* Inside discord go to Server Settings.
* Go to Roles.
* Create a new role, with the name: `IGN: <username>`. The `IGN:` prefix is required for DiscordEQ to detect a player and is used to identify the player in game, For example, to identify the discord user `Xackery` as `Shin`, Create a role named `IGN: Shin`, right click the user Xackery, and assign the role to them.
* If the above user chats inside the assigned channel, their message will appear in game as `Shin says from discord, 'Their Message Here'`

#### Using Users Database

* When talkeq runs, a users.txt file is generated the same directory as talkeq. Peek at the file to see the layout.
* If you write to this file, talkeq will hot reload the contents and update it's lookup table in memory for mapping users from discord to telnet (eq)
* You can write a website to edit this file, or by hand, to update talkeq and sync your player IGN tags
